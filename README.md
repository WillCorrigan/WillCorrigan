<!-- Face Recognition API -->

<details>
<summary>Face Recognition Website</summary>
<br>
This is a website that utilises React/Node.js/Express.js/PostgreSQL. It allows a user to register to the website (which is stored in the database and their password is encrypted with <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt">Bcrypt</a>). Once in the website a user is able to paste a link to an image of a face in a search box. This image is then displayed on the website automatically and a face recognition API (<a href="https://www.clarifai.com/">Clarifai</a>) is contacted (this provides bounding box co-ordinates for a face in an image). I use CSS to render these co-ordinates to display a box around the image highlighting the face. If a face is detected, the user's score is updated.

* Languages/Frameworks Used
  * Javascript
  * React
  * Node/Express

<!-- Django Blog -->

<details>
<summary>Django Blog/Forum</summary>
<br>
When I started learning Python, I very much wanted to learn how to create websites. At the time, I was part of a forum community that was using an extremely outdated forum with no real functionality. I thought that I would take it upon myself to create a better environment to talk in by creating a forum using my newly developing programming skills. 
<br>
Thus, I took it upon myself to learn a very popular Python framework (Django). I started by creating a blog, as I was following a tutorial to get to grips with it but as soon as I learnt that I started progressing on to make the forum itself. I created most of it and enabled user registration (with a database to store usernames/passwords/posts etc) and it was largely completed. I never got around to promoting it, as I left the community shortly after, but I learnt a lot in the process.

* Languages/Frameworks Used
  * Python
  * Django
  * SQLite

## Video Game Development
#### As I was learning programming I was also learning digital art as a hobby alongside it. I thought it would be fun to also learn video game development along with my programming studies so that I could combine both my artistic skills and my new passion. Here are a collection of things that I've created on the way:

These are all created with C# and Unity:

 1. <a target="_blank" href="https://sharemygame.com/@Holyflare/~cbd864e6-db6a-9036-9024-9397e0e52498">Rocket Boost - Playable Demo</a>
  
 2. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WillCorrigan/6_Zombie_Runner">Zombie Survival Game</a>
 
 3. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WillCorrigan/RPG-Project">RPG Project</a>
 
 4. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WillCorrigan/RealmRush">Tower Defence Game</a>
