### 👋 Hi, I'm Will!

I'm a Software Engineer at OVO Energy, specializing in architecting and building scalable, event-driven backend systems on **Google Cloud (GCP)**.

My current expertise is in **TypeScript** and **Node.js**, where I design and lead the development of **microservices** deployed on **GCP (using Kubernetes, ArgoCD and Kustomize)**. I have a strong background in architecting high-throughput data pipelines using **Apache Kafka** and other backend related technologies.

I'm passionate about the entire software lifecycle, from high-level system architecture down to the code. While my professional focus is on the backend, I enjoy building personal projects with Python, Go, C# and dabbling in Next.js and React.

#### Feel free to send me a message!
